# Privacy Policy for 3000 Chistes

**Effective Date:** 2025/12/08

Thank you for using "3000 Chistes," a mobile application developed by Bernier Tech ltd ("we," "us," or "our"). This privacy policy outlines our practices concerning the information that our app may handle.

## Information We Do Not Collect

Our application is designed to be simple and fun. We **do not** collect any personally identifiable information from you. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, or location.

The app uses local storage (`SharedPreferences`) on your device to save your joke scores ("Favorites"). This data remains entirely on your device and is never transmitted, collected, or stored by us.

## Third-Party Services and Data Collection

While our app itself does not collect your data, it uses third-party services that may. It's important for you to be aware of their policies.

*   **Google AdMob:** Our app uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data to provide personalized ads. We encourage you to review Google's Privacy Policy to understand how they handle data: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).

*   **Google Play Services:** Our app also uses Google Play Services to function correctly. This service has its own privacy policy regarding the data it collects. You can find more information here: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Links to Other Sites

The application contains links to external sites (e.g., to purchase the book version on Google Play, Amazon, etc.). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
